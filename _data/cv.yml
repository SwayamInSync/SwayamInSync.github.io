      description: 
        - Allow user to try on different clothes virtually, without going to any trial room.
        - Used ResNet101 and UNet to segment the cloth and model respectively and pose estimation using openpose then final predictions are done using the PyTorch implementation of VITON.
        - SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Metric) of 0.895

      description: 
        - Closed Source LLMs like ChatGPT have knowledge and response limitations resulting in hallucination and non-factual responses.
        - Engineered a custom AI agent capable of autonomously searching the web for information and rendering images, reducing hallucination.
        - Implemented cost-effective strategies to set up the entire project in 0$ making L-WAVE accessible to all users without financial barriers.
        - The objective of keeping 0$ setting up cost leads to custom implementation of every technical detail from integrating web to hosting LLaMA
