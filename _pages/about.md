Hello Internet wanderer! Iâ€™m **Swayam Singh**, an inadvertent wizard in the ever-expanding realm of data science and machine learning. And no, I havenâ€™t been to Hogwarts, but if they ever offer a course in Deep Learning, I'd be the first in line â€“ think of it as the Muggle's Defense Against the Dark Arts!

On the professional front, I've proudly worn the hats of **Data Science Intern**, **Machine Learning Engineer**, and **Open Source Research Engineer**. My ventures in the tech realm encompass pivotal roles from delving into customer retention and mastering the art of **demand forecasting**, to streamlining machine learning pipelines and orchestrating robust **distributed systems**. My hands have danced on **custom CUDA kernels**, ensuring that **MLOps** is not just a buzzword, but a seamlessly integrated practice, and that distributed processing is executed with finesse and efficiency. Furthermore, my **research** escapades allowed me to rub shoulders with some of the brightest minds, resulting in **state-of-the-art Code-gen modelsâ€”twice**, to be precise.

**Hobbies & Fun Bits**:
  - ðŸ“º Binge-watch **Anime** & Groove on the soulful vibes of **POP+R&B**ðŸ¥‚.
  - âš½ Show off some fancy footwork on the football pitch, channeling inner Cedric Diggory vibes.
  - ðŸ“š Occasionally geek out over **Quantum physics**â€”yes, *it's nerdy, but hey, you're in my 'Interests' section*.

My journey in tech has been as thrilling as a _Quidditch_ match, with dizzying highs and the occasional Bludger-like setback. In a twist straight out of a manga, I found myself amidst the prodigious minds of Amazon ML Summer School. Talk about a steep learning curve!

I've embarked on various projects, some of which seemed straight out of a Shonen plotline. If you're seeking someone who's ever-curious, can appreciate a good '_Expelliarmus_' joke, and can pivot from discussing convolutional networks to the latest anime plot twist, you've found your guy. Letâ€™s embark on this enthralling quest together, and who knows? We might just stumble upon the Philosopher's Stone of technologyâ€”or at least code that doesnâ€™t require a Time-Turner to debug!
